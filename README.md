CHECK MY PORTFOLIO  : [https://akash62438.github.io/Portfolio/]

A portfolio is a collection of work samples and documents that demonstrate an individual's skills, experience, and accomplishments. It's commonly used in creative fields like graphic design, photography, writing, and web development, but can also apply to other industries like finance, education, and consulting.

Here are a few key points about portfolios:

Purpose: The main purpose of a portfolio is to showcase a person's abilities, previous projects, or achievements. It serves as evidence of the quality and range of one's work, providing potential employers or clients with a visual or documented representation of their talents.

Types of Portfolios:

Physical Portfolio: A physical binder or folder that contains printed samples of work. This is more common in art and design-related fields.
Digital Portfolio: A website or PDF document that features digital representations of the individual's work. This is essential for most modern careers, especially those in technology, writing, or digital arts.
Social Media Portfolio: Platforms like LinkedIn, Instagram, or Behance can also serve as informal portfolios, where users post their work regularly.
